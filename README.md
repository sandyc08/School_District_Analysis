# School_District_Analysis

Overview

Pycity School District has asked for another analysis of the schools and student scores in their district after discovering that some of the data could potentially have been falsified. The school district believes it was the data for ninth grade students at Thomas High School, that shows evidence of academic dishonesty. The district would like a new analysis done without the altered data to see if there are any possible changes to the original analysis.

Results

After replacing the ninth grade students scores with a null value, I found these changes:
